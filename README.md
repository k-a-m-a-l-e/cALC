This calculator is my first attemtp at WPF, it can perform simple mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication...etc. In order to add a little "something" to it, the calculator offers a small fun fact about the calculated result (only if it's an integer).

## Tools used:
* Visual studio (IDE)
* C# (logic)
* XAML (design)
* Paint.Net (Image editting)

## Numbers fun facts provider (API): 
[Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/)

## Usage:

## TODO:

- [x] Make the API call asynchronous.
- [ ] Adding regex to inputs to solve syntaxe issues.
- [ ] Adding more complex functions (exponentiel, natural logarithm, power..etc).
